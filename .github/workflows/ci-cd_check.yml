    steps:
    # 1. Download your code to the bot's computer
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Install Node.js
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '22'
        cache: 'npm'
        # Important: Tell the cache we have two package-lock files
        cache-dependency-path: |
          client/package-lock.json
          server/package-lock.json

    # 3. Check the SERVER (Node.js)
    - name: Install Server Deps
      run: cd server && npm ci
      
    - name: Build/Test Server
      # If you don't have a "build" script in server, use "node index.js" or similar to check syntax
      # Ideally, add "test": "echo 'No tests'" to server package.json so this passes
      run: cd server && node server.js

    # 4. Check the CLIENT (React)
    - name: Install Client Deps
      run: cd client && npm ci

    - name: Build Client (React)
      # This runs "react-scripts build". If it fails, the Bot turns RED.
      run: cd client && npm run build
